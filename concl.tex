\section{Conclusions and Future Work}
\label{s:sum}

In this report we describe the extension of Cardinal to GPUs including a demonstration simulation on Summit. Cardinal provides a platform for running coupled OpenMC+(Nek5000/NekRS)+BISON. We demonstrated the application of Cardinal with a first-of-a kind simulation on Summit, representing a $10x$ pebble count increase compared to previous simulations. This excerise demonstrates that the Moose-Wrapped-App paradigm is working well even on a GPU platform like Summit.

We aim to massively parallel simulations going up to 80\% of Summit for full core simulations. The current results provide a clear pathway toward full core simulations. Future work on Cardinal will involve a more sophisticated thermal contact treatment between pebbles leveraging novel ideas using MOOSE constraints. Radiation heat transfer will also be added.

These simulations may involve asynchronous parallel execution between the
physics. Finally a multiscale approach may be employed to simulate a select number of fuel particles directly.
